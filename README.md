Advanced UVM
============

**Thank you for your purchase of Advanced UVM!** Every dollar of profit goes to the care and feeding of hungry children in my house. :)

The purpose of these examples is not only to present solutions to the issues demonstrated in the text, but also to demonstrate the presented guidelines and how they can be used to create elegant, readable code.

All of the code presented was simulated with Synopsys(r) VCS 2014.12. Getting this code to run with your simulator and in your environment may require some problem solving on your part.

Please feel free to email <advanced.uvm@gmail.com> with any issues or discrepancies you find in the text. If you have a Kindle or iBooks version, **your book may be updated in the background.**
